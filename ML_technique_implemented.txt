Machine Learning  

Machine learning: A sub field of AI that focuses on machines that take data related to specific tasks and learn from the data in order to build a model. This process enables the generation of an intelligent response to new data presented to the system through the use of algorithms and statistical models that identify patterns and make inferences. [Foundation of AI]Supervised machine learning: models are trained with labeled data sets, which allow the models to learn and grow more accurate over time. Supervised machine learning is the most common type used today. 

Unsupervised machine learning: a program looks for patterns in unlabeled data. Unsupervised machine learning can find patterns or trends that people aren’t explicitly looking for.  
Linear regression  

It is a supervised machine learning model used to do analysis in which the predictor or independent variables are assumed to be related to the criterion or dependent variable in such a manner that increases in an x variable result in consistent increases in the y variable. In other words, the direction and rate of change of one variable is constant with respect to changes in the other variable. The analysis yields a regression equation that includes an intercept and regression coefficients for the predictors. 

General formula:  

y = β₀ + β₁X + ɛ   

y is the dependent variable. 

X is the independent variable  

β₀ is the constant and, 

ɛ is the Random error term.
